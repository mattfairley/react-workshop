#React Workshop

Welcome to the react workshop for the Nascent Hackathon. This code-along will help get you familiar with React and some of the core concepts: Components, state, props, rendering, and the component lifecycle.

The project is organized into two main folders - final-version, which is what we will be making, and start-here, where you will be working. The project is run on Webpack with ðŸ”¥ hot module replacement ðŸ”¥, which works very much like browsersync to reload the page while we're working, but better (if harder to set up).

Make sure you are in the start-here folder before beginning.

##Steps

Make sure you have node installed, and as recent a version as possible.

`git clone https://github.com/mattfairley/react-workshop.git`

`cd react-workshop`

`npm install`

`npm start`

### Additional things you can do:

`npm build` will minify the bundle and put it into the `dist` folder.
