#React Workshop

Welcome to the react workshop for the Nascent Hackathon. This code-along will help get you familiar with React and some of the core concepts: Components, state, props, rendering, and the component lifecycle.

The project is organized into two main folders - final-version, which is what we will be making, and start-here, where you will be working. Each have their own gulp workflow, so make sure you are in the start-here folder before beginning.

##Steps

Make sure you have node installed and gulp installed globally
`npm install gulp -g`

`git clone https://github.com/mattfairley/react-workshop.git`

`cd react-workshop`

`npm install`

`cd start-here`

`gulp`
